4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Calculating Edit Distance Using Dynamic Programming): Problem 1
   took a long time for me to figure out. It was a huge step from the past 5
   that I had previously done, because we had to work with 2D arrays (whereas
   in Pascal's triangle, it was a ragged array). I watched a youtube video
   that someone had posted on Piazza hoping that it would be helpful, but I
   still could not figure out what the program is supposed to code. I reached
   out to an upperclassman who had already taken the class and he walked me
   thorugh some examples (SPAM and HAM on the Checklist page). After that, I
   basically followed through the checklist. One tiny error I encountered that
   got resolved by Laura Chamberlain was a "self.AssertEqual(got, sought)"
   error. I found out that at the end, I had to include stdio.write(x) and y,
   before writing the dimensions of the matrix to standard output. I also have
   a style error whenever I run pycodestyle since some of my lines exceed 80
   characters, so I used a backslash to insert onto a new line and aligned it
   with the function max() and min().

   Problem 2 (Recovering the Alignment): I knew that in order to do this
   program, I had to have correctly coded edit_distance.py because the example
   command-line input had that Problem, as well as '<' and '|', two symbols I
   have never seen before. Since Problem 1 was all set, I got started on the
   coding aspect. I did not know to to read from standard input the 2D matrix
   opt, so I looked it up online. I knew to use an if-elif-else statement
   because of the format of the conditions on the checklist, and I used another
   if statement for if either x or y is exhausted before y or x. I did not know
   we even had a data directory so I tried to input my own values before reali-
   zing that there was, and from there I just used those files as testers.
 
5. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Raymond Huang  grad  helped me figure out the basics of Problem 1
   Laura Chamberlain  SI Instructor  helped with errors in my code for project1
   Swami Iyer  professor  helped me figure out why my matrix printing diff. #s

6. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was exponentially more difficult than Project 1. It
   took me a couple hours to even understand what genetic sequencing
   was, and I used multiple online sources (such as the youtube video
   regarding calculating edit distance posted on Piazza) to help me
   comprehend the material. I did, however, feel accomplished when I
   successfully completed the project!
